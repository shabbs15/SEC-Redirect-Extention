Redirects SEC fillings from ixrbl to pure html

Only works with Chrome at the moment

How to integrate onto Chrome:

1. Download files
2. Go on to chrome://extensions/
3. Click "load unpacked", in the top left corner
4. Select the folder containing the extention
5. Voila, whenever you go on to an SEC filling with IXRBl, you will automatically be redirected to html
